# GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces provides instant cloud development environments directly from GitHub repositories.

## Performance concerns

In my experiences GitHub Codespaces are a simple way to spin up an a service, but they can be a bit slow to start which from a user perspective makes them feel a bit unreliable, so I wouldn't recommend them for anything more than a quick demo.  

GitHub Codespaces are a great idea, but you are probably better off hosting your service on a dedicated VM or locally using WSL2.

## Core Features
- **Automatic repo mounting**: Repo cloned to `/workspaces/<repo-name>` with live Git sync
- **Devcontainer.json**: Configures tools, Docker, ports, extensions via `.devcontainer/` [docs.github](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/about-codespaces/codespaces-features)
- **Port forwarding**: Auto-detects `localhost:PORT`, creates public URLs, opens browser [docs.github](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace)
- **VS Code native**: Browser or desktop VS Code with full extension support
- **Multi-VM sizes**: 2-core/8GB → 32-core/128GB, pay-per-use after free quota
- A codespace will suspend after a period of inactivity. You can specify a default idle timeout value, which will apply to all codespaces created after the default is changed. You will be charged for the entire time your codespace is running, even if it is idle. The maximum value is 240 minutes (4 hours).
- Inactive codespaces are automatically deleted 30 days after the last time they were stopped. A shorter retention period can be set, and will apply to all codespaces created going forward. The default and maximum value is 30 days.
- Your default region will be used to designate compute resources to your codespaces. GitHub can set your region automatically based on your location, or you can set it yourself. Codespaces are deployed to a subset of Azure regions.

## Pricing (March 2026)
| Plan | Core-hours/month | Storage | Notes |
|------|------------------|---------|-------|
| Free | 120 core-hours | 15 GB | ~30hr on 4-core machine |
| Pro | Same + priority | Same | Faster queue |
| Team/Ent | Unlimited | Unlimited | Org billing |

## Workflow
```
Repo → Codespace → /workspaces/repo → VS Code → docker compose up → Ports tab → Public URLs
```

**Nautobot** is an open-source Network Source of Truth (NSoT) and automation platform, forked from NetBox. [networktocode](https://networktocode.com/nautobot/)

Key capabilities :
- **Source of Truth**: Models network infrastructure (devices, IPs, cables, racks) with custom fields/relationships
- **Automation Platform**: REST/GraphQL APIs, Git integration, webhooks drive Ansible/Terraform workflows
- **App Ecosystem**: Extensible plugin system for custom models, jobs, and integrations

Key for network engineers: Nautobot validates data, syncs disparate sources, enables intent-based networking, and supports multi-vendor device modeling with dynamic config generation.[](https://networktocode.com/nautobot/)[](https://docs.nautobot.com/projects/core/en/stable/)

## Codespaces notes

1. Create your own codespace using this repo - or fork the repo if you want to make changes.
2. Codespaces allow you to test code for free, you get ~30hr on a 4-core machine.
3. Create your new Codespaces instance using the options shown in the screenshot below.
4. The first time we start nautobot, we need to run `createsuperuser` from the vscode terminal to setup a Login and Password ( in the example we used admin / admin but feel free to use whatever you prefer ).
5. From the vscode terminal we can open the Nautobot web UI and login.
6. Lastly we can rename the Codespaces instance, or delete it when we are done etc.
